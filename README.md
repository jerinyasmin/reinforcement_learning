# reinforcement_learning

We have followed the implementation from the following paper: 
Gupta, Rahul, Aditya Kanade, and Shirish Shevade. "Deep reinforcement learning for programming language correction." arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.10467 (2018).


A3C implementaion is done based on this work: https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents/blob/master/A3C-Doom.ipynb
